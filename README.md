# blobogotchi

A web virtual pet game using Phaser 3.

# Setup

1. Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to make managing node versions painless!
2. Install `http-server` globally by running `npm install -g http-server`. You'll need it for simple static file serving.
3. Once installed, navigate to this project's folder in terminal and run `http-server`.

Game should be up and running on localhost:8080! ðŸŽ‰
